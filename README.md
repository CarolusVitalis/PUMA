## Project Overview
PUMA aims to develop an AI model that can identify promoter sequences in existing databases. This project is designed to overcome the challenges of misclassification of genetic parts in repositories like the iGEM Part Repository or SynBioHub, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the genetic parts.
